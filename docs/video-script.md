Locuno: Community Wallet + Social Credit — 5-Minute Pitch & Demo (Sam Altman style)

Duration: 5:00
Audience: HDBank, Sovico ecosystem, hackathon judges
Tone: Calm, ambitious, grounded in outcomes

0:00 — Cold open
[Camera on presenter]
What if communities could govern money with the same clarity and trust we expect from software? What if good community behavior unlocked real credit access? Locuno is a community wallet with a social credit engine. Locuno is the Safety Platform for families and neighbors in Vietnam, and this project builds an add-on ecosystem around Locuno that combines with Fintech. We turn transparency into trust, and trust into finance.

0:15 — The problem (Vietnam context)
[Minimal slides: Opaque, Inequal, Manual]
Across Vietnam, apartment funds, school associations, and neighborhood groups run on Zalo and Excel. Opaque processes lead to suspicion, conflict, and sometimes corruption. Banks struggle to assess community-level trust, so responsible members are excluded from credit. There’s no shared source of truth.

0:35 — The solution
[Slide: Community Wallet + Social Credit]
Locuno fixes both sides:
- Community Wallet: Every transaction is transparent. Every decision is democratic with 2/3 approvals. Real-time, immutable ledger. VietQR deposits via SePay/HDBank.
- Social Credit: A 0–100 score from explainable signals—participation, voting compliance, proposal quality, payment history. High-trust members unlock community-backed loans.
Result: Transparent governance + trust-based finance.

1:00 — The breakthrough
[Slide: Business Logic Blockchain]
Traditional blockchains are heavy and slow; spreadsheets are fragile and opaque. We built a business logic blockchain: selective immutability for critical actions, democratic consensus baked into protocol, and real-time updates. Frontend is React; backend is Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects; security through JWT, eKYC, and multi-signature approvals. It’s fast, auditable, and production-ready.

1:25 — What this enables
[Slide: Trust Economy]
- Transparency: 100% visibility for all community members.
- Democracy: Spending requires 2/3 votes.
- Credit Access: Trust-based loans for responsible members.
- ESG: Automatic social impact tracking and an audit trail.

1:40 — Live demo (end-to-end flow)
[Switch to product]
We’ll show the complete trust economy in five steps.

Step 1 — Deposit via VietQR (1:40–2:00)
[Dashboard: Balance; Action: Generate VietQR; Simulate payment]
A member deposits through VietQR. The ledger updates instantly with cryptographic proof. Everyone sees the money flow. No surprises.

Step 2 — Social credit recompute (2:00–2:30)
[Credit Score page: Recompute]
The social credit engine recalculates to a 0–100 score. It shows reasons—voting participation, payment reliability, proposal outcomes—and suggests how to improve. It’s explainable by design.

Step 3 — Loan application (2:30–3:00)
[Loan page: Apply]
A high-trust member applies for a small community-backed loan. Threshold met, auto-approval. The schedule is generated with clear terms. No hidden fees, no opaque underwriting.

Step 4 — Disbursement and repayment (3:00–3:30)
[Action: Disburse]
Funds are disbursed into the wallet. Repayment is dead-simple: via SMS—“REPAY <ID> <amount>”. The ledger records it, the schedule updates, and the member’s social credit reflects responsible behavior.

Step 5 — Democratic spending (3:30–4:00)
[Proposals: Create expense]
We create a community proposal—say, playground maintenance. Members vote; when 2/3 approve, the transaction executes. The audit trail captures who voted, when, and how the funds moved. Zero ambiguity.

Bonus — ESG dashboard (4:00–4:15)
[ESG view]
All actions contribute to ESG metrics—transparency, participation, governance. It’s measurable. It’s reportable. It’s aligned with regulation.

4:15 — Business impact for HDBank
[Slide: Revenue + Risk]
- Community deposits (CASA growth) from transparent fund management.
- Trust-based lending: Expand credit safely with social signals; target 2% default rate.
- B2B2C channel: Organized communities as direct distribution.
- ESG compliance: Auditable social impact for regulators.

4:35 — Rollout plan and metrics
[Slide: Pilot]
Phase 1: 5 residential communities (500 families) — wallet + basic scoring.
Phase 2: 10 school associations — democratic fund management.
Phase 3: HDBank branch integration — trust-based lending pilot.
Targets: 10B VND managed funds; 100M VND in trust-based loans; 95% transparency; 80% democratic participation; 3x Sovico ecosystem engagement.

4:55 — Close: The trust infrastructure
[Camera back to presenter]
We’re not just fixing spreadsheets. We’re building Vietnam’s trust infrastructure—where every transaction is transparent, every decision is democratic, and good behavior unlocks opportunity. Locuno turns community trust into an economic engine.

Call to action
Let’s start a pilot. Five communities, one quarter. If we hit the metrics, we scale across HDBank and the Sovico ecosystem.

Thank you.
