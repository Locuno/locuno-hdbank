## The Problem We're Solving

### Two Universal Challenges in Vietnam

**Personal Trust Gap**
- Parents worry: "Did my child arrive safely at school?"
- Adult children wonder: "Are my elderly parents okay?"
- No secure, private way to stay connected with loved ones

**Community Trust Deficit**
- Apartment buildings, school associations, neighborhood groups
- Manual fund management through Zalo + Excel
- Opaque processes breeding suspicion and conflict

> *At their core: The absence of digital infrastructure built specifically for trust*
