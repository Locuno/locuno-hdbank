"Hello. Locuno is Vietnam's safety platform for families and neighbors. But safety isn't just physical; it's also financial. And right now, community finance in Vietnam is broken."

"Across apartment buildings, school associations, and neighborhoods, funds are managed in Zalo groups and Excel files. This creates a black box. It drives suspicion, conflict, and sometimes corruption. Because there's no shared source of truth, banks can't see who to trust, excluding millions of responsible people from fair credit."

The Solution: A Two-Part Answer

"To fix this, you have to solve two problems at once: **transparency** and **trust**. Our solution does exactly that."

"First, for transparency, we built the **Community Wallet**. Every transaction is visible to every member in a real-time, unchangeable ledger. Deposits are seamless via VietQR. Every spending decision requires 2/3 democratic approval. It’s a glass box."

"Second, to build trust, we created a **Social Credit Engine**. It generates a simple 0-100 score based on positive community behavior—like paying dues on time or participating in votes. This score is fully explainable. And high trust unlocks access to community-backed loans."

"The result: Transparent governance and trust-based finance, delivered through the safety platform communities already use."

The Technical Breakthrough: The Trust Engine

"But how do you *guarantee* this transparency and trust at scale? A simple database is insecure. A full blockchain is too slow and expensive. That’s why we engineered our own **Business Logic Blockchain**."

"It uses selective immutability for critical financial events and bakes democratic consensus directly into the protocol. It’s fast, auditable, and built on a modern, secure stack: Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, and JWT authentication."

The Value Proposition: A New Business Model

"This technology unlocks a powerful new business model for HDBank:"
- "**New Deposits:** The transparency of the Community Wallet will drive significant CASA growth."
- "**Safer Lending:** Our Social Credit score de-risks lending and opens a new, credit-worthy market segment."
- "**New Distribution:** It provides a direct B2B2C channel into thousands of organized communities."
- "**Measurable ESG:** And it delivers a fully auditable trail of positive social impact."

"For communities, it means democratic control, fair credit access, and an end to fraud. For the Sovico ecosystem, it’s a loyalty OS that enables new services."

The Demo 

The Live Trust Economy

"Now, let me show you how this trust economy works. Welcome to the Locuno dashboard for a local apartment community."

**(3:30) Step 1: Transparent Deposits**

"It all starts with a single source of truth. A member makes a deposit via VietQR. Watch the balance update in real-time. Every member sees this instantly. No more black boxes."

**(3:50) Step 2: Building Trust**

"This transparency feeds our trust engine. Every positive action, like paying dues on time, improves your Social Credit Score. It’s not a mystery; the platform shows you exactly why your score is what it is and how to improve it."

**(4:10) Step 3: Unlocking Credit for All**

"And high trust unlocks real financial opportunity. This is where we bridge the gap for those outside the traditional credit system. A member with a high score can apply for a personal micro-loan, approved instantly based on their proven trustworthiness."

"But it's not just for individuals. The community can also vote to fund collective projects—like fixing the playground or upgrading security. This is community-led development, financed by a system everyone trusts."

Step 4: Democratic Governance

"Finally, let's see democratic spending in action. The community wants to fix the playground. A proposal is created. Only when 2/3 of members vote to approve are the funds released. This is accountability by design."

The Vision

"So, we’ve gone from an opaque Zalo group to a fully transparent, democratic, and credit-enabled financial ecosystem."

"Locuno is building the trust infrastructure for Vietnam's communities. We invite you to join us in piloting the future of finance—one that is safer, more transparent, and more inclusive for everyone."

"Thank you."
